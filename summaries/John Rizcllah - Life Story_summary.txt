 John was born in Amarillo, Texas, and his family moved frequently during his childhood. He lived in Lebanon during kindergarten, attending a strict Catholic school and learning Arabic, which he no longer speaks. After his paternal grandmother's death, they moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where John attended St. Pius X Catholic school and his father worked at family-owned fast food restaurants. In 3rd grade, they moved to Virginia when his father joined the U.S. Department of State. They lived in Falls Church briefly before settling in Warrenton, where John attended public school for the first time and disliked it. John's family lived in Sana'a, Yemen, for two years, enjoying trips to historical sites like Dar al-Hajar and nature spots like Karaman Island. They also visited cities such as Aden and Hodeidah. John attended Sana'a British School for fourth and fifth grade, where he thrived in its small, self-paced learning environment. The family then moved to Muscat, Oman, where John attended The American International School of Muscat (TAISM) for sixth to eighth grade. He continued to excel academically and played soccer, with his 8th-grade team securing 3rd place in an international tournament in Dubai. John loved visiting Dubai with his family while living in Oman. When he moved to Amarillo, Texas for 9th grade, he attended Holy Cross Catholic Academy, which he disliked due to its limited perspective and difficulty in fitting in. Despite this, he scored in the top 2% nationally on the SATs and received a full academic scholarship to St. John's University in NYC. Post high school, John struggled with his ambitions, enrolling in various universities and majors, including music composition, philosophy, and psychology. John held various sales jobs, including selling electronics, steak-knives, insurance, and car rentals, but enjoyed selling cars the most as he felt he was helping people. Despite this, he did not want a lifelong sales career and explored other jobs such as an EMT, painter, fast food worker, and briefly worked in a cornfield before discovering an allergy to corn pollen. One day, he found beanactuary.org and became intrigued by actuarial science. John, initially good at math but unfamiliar with advanced problems, enrolled at Amarillo College as a math major. He enjoyed studying math and earned an associate's degree before pursuing a Bachelor's degree at West Texas A&M University. At WT, he studied probability, statistics, financial mathematics, and modeling, focusing on real-world applications. He graduated in 2017, completing an undergraduate research project on the Cox-Ingersoll Ross model of interest rate evolution, which he derived using stochastic calculus. John developed a Matlab program to forecast interest rate changes and discovered his interest in quantitative finance over actuarial science. He earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics in May 2017 and a master's degree from West Texas A&M University in January 2018. In grad school, he focused on statistics, particularly in finance, and his thesis involved coding a complex nested Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm (SMC^2) to perform inference and estimate parameters of a state-space model. He used this R program to identify inflationary bubbles in the USD/JPY exchange rate. John's proudest achievement is his thesis, which applied machine learning and data science to an understudied area of economics. His work shifted his interest from actuarial science and quantitative finance to machine learning and data science. During grad school, he worked as a graduate assistant in the math department, lecturing four classesâ€”one in developmental college algebra and three in business calculus. John valued his students' abilities, assigning challenging problems and encouraging collaborative problem-solving, leading to higher-than-average pass rates. John participated in a data science mentorship program with Springboard under the guidance of Dipanjan Sarkar, a well-known figure in the data science community. Since his university, WT, didn't offer courses in data science or machine learning, this mentorship was crucial for him. John read several books on applied data science, including "Machine Learning for Algorithmic Trading" by Stefan Jansen. This book covers data science concepts from linear regression to deep learning, explaining each theory and its real-world application. John gained significant knowledge through this mentorship and reading. John started his YouTube channel, John the Quant, to deepen his understanding by teaching and to help others learn difficult topics. His content includes stochastic calculus, quantitative finance, algorithm finance, data science, and machine learning. His videos were well-received and helped him secure a job at Kalibri Labs. At Kalibri Labs, a startup providing benchmarks and forecasts to the hotel industry, John worked as a data scientist. Despite not initially considering this field, he found it fascinating and enjoyed learning and working with his coworkers, particularly his direct supervisor, Mark Mazz. John, leveraging his hospitality experience and discussions with Mark, significantly improved Kalibri Labs' forecasts by applying his machine learning, modeling, and statistical knowledge. Kalibri Labs offered three data science algorithms: Prediction, Estimation, and Optimal Business Mix, with John focusing on and enhancing all three. Amidst the post-pandemic hospitality rebound and company growth, John addressed the challenge of scaling time-intensive algorithms. He studied Python performance tuning and successfully reduced the processing time of the Prediction Algorithm by 20% by eliminating wasteful or repetitive functions. John improved an algorithm's speed by implementing a new parallelization technique and rewriting suboptimal functions in Cython, without changing the results. He had additional scaling recommendations but wasn't given time to implement them. For the Estimation algorithm, which benchmarks hotels, the output was too large to load onto the platform. John noticed repeated numbers in the matrices and suggested sparsifying them by saving each value once with a map to its position, instead of saving each value multiple times. John suggested saving output values in smaller data types, reducing size by switching from float64 to float32. The Optimal Business Mix algorithm, initially in R, was translated to Python but ran too slowly and crashed with many constraints. John performed benchmarking, identified bottlenecks, and advised converting loops to array functions, breaking loops into smaller, parallelized loops, and using the Jacobian for faster optimizer convergence. John led several projects at Kalibri Labs, where he devised an NLP algorithm to map vague company descriptions to official names, designed a customer health algorithm to optimize limited user data, and created an automated hyperparameter tuning algorithm for optimal model performance. His research showed that regular re-tuning was necessary for accuracy, prompting his automation efforts. Additionally, rker implemented John's ideas, resulting in a faster and more stable algorithm compared to the R version. John automated the hyperparameter tuning process using a Bayesian search algorithm. Initial hyperparameters were randomly sampled from distributions based on previous trial outcomes. After each run, the algorithm conducted diagnostic tests, calculated metrics, generated visualizations, and created a tearsheet for analysts to assess the set's effectiveness. The optimizer would then select a more optimal candidate and repeat the process. The algorithm aimed to choose the best-performing hyperparameters through iterative refinement. John proposed automating the selection of hyperparameters and rewriting the Prediction algorithm accordingly, with human review for optimization results. The customer success team at Kalibri Labs was overwhelmed with hundreds of clients each. To optimize their time, John suggested developing an automated "customer health score" based on limited customer happiness data and no retention data. He planned to use customer engagement as a proxy for happiness, assuming frequent users are satisfied. Due to limited engagement data, John opted for a classical statistical modeling technique. John developed an automated model that segmented customers by usage statistics and calculated transition statistics for each segment. This model significantly improved monthly customer usage predictions over naive assumptions and human forecasts. Data was pulled via an API, processed, and forecasts were uploaded to Salesforce, and then packaged as an executable. This allowed non-technical employees to update health scores easily, enhancing customer understanding and saving the team hundreds of hours monthly. The NLP project was noted as the largest, hardest, and most impactful. Hotels use non-standardized corporate codes to identify business customers, complicating market-wide analysis of bookings. Kalibri Labs needed to map these codes across different hotels. Initially, a data analyst manually mapped around 3,000 codes in a year. John developed an algorithm that mapped over 130,000 codes in a few months. He utilized company descriptions, often non-standard, to connect corporate accounts. The descriptions were cleaned and consolidated to ensure uniqueness before processing. The process involved using the Google Search API to retrieve search results in JSON format, which were then analyzed by a fine-tuned transformer-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to identify corporate names. John trained this NER model. The algorithm, designed to achieve at least 90% accuracy, ultimately reached 93% accuracy by corporate code and over 99% by room count, mapping over 99% of rooms to the correct corporate account. This solution addressed the lack of corporate account information, a significant issue for customers and salespeople, and facilitated faster company growth. John, a data scientist with a growth mindset, seeks to make a significant impact through generative AI, believing in the power of combining data and leadership. He has started a data science program at the Community College of Aurora to educate students in data science and AI. Despite holding a master's degree in math, John plans to continue his formal education to contribute further through academic research. He aims to change the world and help others do the same, making him an excellent candidate for a leadership role on your team.
