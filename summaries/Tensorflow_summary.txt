 John Rizcallah completed three online, non-credit courses authorized by DeepLearning.AI and offered through Coursera: "Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning" on Feb 24, 2022, "Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow" on Mar 3, 2022, and "Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow" on Mar 8, 2022. The courses were led by Laurence Moroney, Lead AI Advocate at Google. Coursera confirmed Rizcallah's identity and participation in each course. Verification links are provided for the first two courses. John Rizcallah successfully completed several online, non-credit courses authorized by DeepLearning.AI and offered through Coursera. The courses include "Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning," "Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow," "Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow," and "Sequences, Time Series and Prediction." These courses were completed by March 10, 2022, under the instruction of Laurence Moroney, Lead AI Advocate at Google. Coursera has verified the identity of John Rizcallah and his participation in these courses. Verification links are provided for the individual courses. Congratulations on completing the DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate program. You have learned to build and train neural networks, improve network performance with convolutions, and develop natural language processing systems. This knowledge will be vital for the AI-powered future. Note that the online courses are not equivalent to on-campus courses and do not confer university grades, credits, degrees, or verify identity. John Rizcallah has completed two online non-credit courses authorized by DeepLearning.AI and offered through Coursera: "Browser-based Models with TensorFlow.js" verified on March 19, 2022, and "Device-based Models with TensorFlow Lite" verified on March 28, 2022. Both courses were confirmed by Coursera and led by Laurence Moroney, Lead AI Advocate at Google. Verification links are provided for both certificates. John Rizcallah has successfully completed the online non-credit course "Data Pipelines with TensorFlow Data Services" authorized by DeepLearning.AI and offered through Coursera. Additionally, he completed the four-course specialization "TensorFlow: Data and Deployment," covering browser-based models with TensorFlow.js, device-based models with TensorFlow Lite, data pipelines with TensorFlow Data Services, and advanced deployment scenarios with TensorFlow, verified by Coursera on April 8, 2022. John Rizcallah completed the "Advanced Deployment Scenarios with TensorFlow" course, an online non-credit course authorized by DeepLearning.AI and offered through Coursera. The course includes material similar to on-campus courses but does not provide university enrollment, grades, course credit, or a degree. The certificate, verified by Laurence Moroney, Lead AI Advocate at Google, can be checked at the provided Coursera link. Coursera has verified the identity of this individual and their participation in the course. Verification can be confirmed at https://coursera.org/verify/CSAYHS6LJ44P.
