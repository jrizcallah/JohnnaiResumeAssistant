 John switched his major to mathematics after finding a challenging actuarial practice exam.
 He passed the first two actuarial exams and developed a love for challenges.
 His college journey involved multiple majors at various universities, ultimately leading to expertise in mathematics,
 statistics, and machine learning.
 Studies in psychology, music, emergency medicine, finance, and philosophy provided a broad perspective,
 helping him connect theoretical mathematics to real-world applications.
 His master's thesis involved applying economic understanding.
 John used Bayesian statistics to develop a semi-supervised method for identifying bubbles in foreign exchange rates
 and created trading strategies based on this method. John programmed in R and documented his thesis in R Markdown.
 He later joined Springboard to gain practical data science skills, learning Python, SQL, and NLP,
 and to effectively communicate data-driven insights.

 John's previous experience includes roles as a teacher, salesman, and musician,
 where he honed his skills in communication and research.
 Kalibri Labs Data Scientist (July 2022 - May 2024):
 Maintained and enhanced production algorithms, performed statistical and business research,
 and completed several projects. Key achievements include reducing the running time of an optimization algorithm by
 80%, designing a deduplication algorithm with 93% accuracy using Google API, increasing algorithm speed,
 efficiency, and security, overhauling the unit testing process for over 100 functions,
 and translating algorithm inputs/outputs into business logic for client understanding.
 Implemented an automated hyperparameter tuning system and developed a customer churn model using Salesforce data,
 reducing a monthly process from 70 hours to a data-driven approach. Conducted forecasting experiments with various
 models and tuning using Optuna. Participated in the Springboard Data Science Fellowship,
 involving 550+ hours of training, completion of two capstone projects, and mastering skills in Python, SQL,
 data analysis, visualization, hypothesis testing, and machine learning.
 John is worked on an ensemble reinforcement learning for futures trading,
 involving data preparation for 78 futures contracts.
 He developed and implemented A2C, PPO, and DDPG reinforcement learning algorithms for trading models,
 with an ongoing ensemble system. Current metrics include a Sharpe Ratio of 1.006, Annualized Return of 4.5%,
 and Maximum Drawdown of -0.25. John conducted a data-driven sentiment analysis on 15 major publications using the
 VADER Lexicon algorithm, analyzing over 140,000 articles and employing methods like Linear Regression, ANOVA,
 Tukey HSD, and clustering techniques. His research was done in Python.
 John also served as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at West Texas A&M University from August 2019 to May 2020.
 He has extensive experience in education and music. He taught complex mathematical concepts,
 achieving a pass rate over 50%, and managed classrooms as a substitute teacher for Amarillo ISD.
 John also served as a mathematics tutor for various organizations and as an independent contractor.
 In the music field, John was the lead vocalist for the bands Rock Bottom and Surfin' 66, performing for large groups
 and learning numerous songs. His roles involved lecturing, classroom management, on-call duties,
 and performing music, demonstrating versatility in diverse public-speaking and leadership environments.
 John developed personalized lesson plans and scheduled tutoring sessions.
