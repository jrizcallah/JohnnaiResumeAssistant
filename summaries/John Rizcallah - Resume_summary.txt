John's experience with projects.
John developed JohnnAI Resume Assistant in May 2024, connected to ChatGPT and documents via Langchain,
and deployed on Streamlit.
He created a CNN-LSTM Forecasting and Portfolio Optimization project in May-June 2021,
developing neural network models to predict stock behavior and optimize portfolios, outperforming benchmarks with an
annual Sharpe ratio of 0.90. John worked on Ensemble Reinforcement Learning for Futures Trading from March-May 2021,
preparing price data on 78 futures contracts. He implemented A2C, PPO, and DDPG reinforcement learning algorithms for
trading with OpenAI Gym.
John analyzed sentiment in over 140,000 news articles to identify bias in 15 publications using linear regression,
Tukey HSD, clustering methods.
