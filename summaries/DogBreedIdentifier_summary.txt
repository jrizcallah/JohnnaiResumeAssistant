 John Rizcallah built a Dog Breed Identifier app to determine the breed of his dog, Bino, whose mom was a Pekinese and whose dad's breed is unknown. Using transfer learning with Xception, InceptionV3, and Resnet152v2 models, John created an ensemble model that predicts the top 5 most likely breeds from a picture. The app, installed on John's Android phone, identified Bino as either a Chihuahua or a Pug, which matched common guesses. Similar apps yielded the same results when tested with Bino's pictures. The text includes code for a dog breed recognition project. It imports necessary libraries, suppresses warnings, and defines helper functions. The `build_model_list` function loads three pre-trained models (Xception, InceptionV3, ResNet152V2) from specified file paths. The `load_breed_dict` function loads a dictionary of dog breeds from a pickle file. The provided code defines several functions for predicting dog breeds from images using a list of models. The `prediction` function averages the predictions from multiple models. The `translate_prediction` function interprets the prediction probability, returning 'Unsure' if the highest probability is below 20%. The `get_top_5_predictions` and `get_top_5_probabilities` functions retrieve the indexes and probabilities of the top 5 predictions, respectively. Finally, `return_prediction` compiles the top 5 breeds and their probabilities into a formatted DataFrame with additional Google search links for more information. The provided code defines functions for predicting dog breeds from images using a set of trained models. The `image_prediction_function` processes an image to get the top 5 breed predictions and their probabilities. The `master_function` builds the list of models and loads a breed dictionary, then handles image uploads, processes each image, and displays predictions. The script executes the `master_function` if run as the main module.
