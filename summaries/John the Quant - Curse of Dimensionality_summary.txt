 John the Quant announces a return after 14 months and plans to discuss the
 "curse of dimensionality" in machine learning. He explains that while more data and features generally lead to
 more flexible and accurate models, they can also make it harder to build a well-fitting model.
 More features can sometimes worsen the model's performance, even if overfitting is avoided.
 John intends to further explore this concept using an iPad demonstration.

 The curse of dimensionality refers to the phenomenon where adding more dimensions (features) increases the
 distance between data points, making them more separable but also complicating model training and fitting.
 As each new dimension enlarges the distance between points, it can initially seem beneficial for differentiation
 but actually makes building effective models harder. John further explored this concept using a Colab notebook.
 John discussed his interest in Plotly and Dash, and hints at a possible future video on Dash.
 In the video, John created a dataset with three randomly generated features: x_1, x_2, and x_3.
 The target classification is based on the sum of x_1 and x_2, while x_3 does not affect the target.
 A color map (cmap) is used to assign colors to each target class for easier plot interpretation.
 The data should ideally be in two dimensions (x_1 and x_2) for perfect accuracy, though it is initially shown in one
 dimension. John discussed drawing lines to separate four classes with specific equations, confirming a perfect
 solution. These equations are: x_1 < -x_2 + 0.5 (blue), x_1 < -x_2 + 1 (yellow), x_1 < -x_2 + 1.5 (red),
 and x_1 > -x_2 + 1.5 (green). It emphasizes the importance of visualizing data in 3D, including a superfluous
 x_3 feature, to identify irrelevant features. John suggests that graphical examination during EDA can reveal
 superfluous features more effectively than statistical tests, highlighting the curse of dimensionality when
 additional features complicate the analysis. In lower dimensions, separating data points seems easy, but in higher
 dimensions, it's challenging to determine the correct separations, a phenomenon known as the curse of dimensionality.
 This makes it difficult to distinguish between models that look good and those that are genuinely effective.
 One solution to this problem is obtaining more data, though this often requires exponentially more data,
 which can be very costly. John discussed the curse of dimensionality, where increasing features in a dataset makes
 it harder to achieve optimal model parameters. They mention upcoming videos on dimensionality reduction techniques
 like principal component analysis and t-SNE. John encourages feedback, likes, and subscriptions with notifications
