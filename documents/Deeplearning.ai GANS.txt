 John Rizcallah
 has successfu ly completed the online, non-credit Specialization
 Generative Adversarial
 Networks (GANs)
 Congratulations! John Rizcallah has completed a l 3 courses of Generative
 Adversarial Networks - a DeepLearning.AI Specialization. As part of this
 Specialization, John Rizcallah has learned the classical machine learning skils
 and the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques needed to build
 GANs models. John Rizcallah is now equipped to design applications that
 perform image generation and image-to-image translation using
 GANs! These, and other generative applications, are going to be at the
 forefront of the coming transformation to an AI-powered future.
 The online specialization named in this certificate may draw on material from courses taught on-campus, but the included
 courses are not equivalent to on-campus courses. Participation in this online specialization does not constitute enrollment
 at this university. This certificate does not confer a University grade, course credit or degree, and it does not verify the
 identity of the learner.
