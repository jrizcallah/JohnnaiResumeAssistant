 Certificate
 DeepLearning.AI
 TensorFlow Developer
 Congratulations! You have completed a l 4 courses of the
 DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate
 program. As part of this Professional Certificate program, you have
 learned: how to build and train neural networks using TensorFlow,
 how to improve network performance using convolutions as you train
 it to identify real-world images, how to teach machines to understand,
 analyze, and respond to human speech with natural language
 processing systems, and more! These, and other TensorFlow
 concepts, are going to be at the forefront of the coming
 transformation to an AI-powered future.
 The online specialization named in this certificate may draw on material from courses taught on-campus, but the included
 courses are not equivalent to on-campus courses. Participation in this online specialization does not constitute enrollment
 at this university. This certificate does not confer a University grade, course credit or degree, and it does not verify the
 identity of the learner.

 John Rizcallah
 has successfu ly completed the online, non-credit Specialization
 TensorFlow: Data and
 Deployment
 In this specialization, you continued to develop your understanding of
 machine learning with TensorFlow: Data and Deployment. You have
 gone beyond basic modeling and learned how to train and run your
 models within a browser, optimize machine learning models for mobile
 devices, and create effective data pipelines with TensorFlow Data
 Services. Now that you’ve learned the various ways to deploy your
 models, you’re wel-prepared to take your models into the hands of
 real people on al kinds of devices!
