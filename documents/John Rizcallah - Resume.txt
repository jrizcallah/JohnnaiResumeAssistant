SUMMARY
John is an experienced data scientist and machine learning engineer with 4 years of experience,
specialized in time series forecasting and natural language processing.
Past projects include designing an algorithm that integrates with the Google API to map unclean corporate descriptions
to standardized corporation names using NLP methods, constructing a complex reinforcement learning AI for
futures trading, and detecting bubbles in the FX markets by Sequential Monte Carlo methods.
A confident and charismatic speaker with years of sales experience, who will jump at the chance to present
technical results to a non-technical audience. A detail-oriented risk-taker, a collaborative multitasker,
and an innovative researcher.

Kalibri Labs	June 2022 – May 2024
Data Scientist
Reprogrammed algorithms for efficiency, decreasing runtime of two products by 20% and 80%
Designed and implemented a new NLP product that leverages the Google Search API to map unstructured,
uncleaned text to corporate names with 93% accuracy
Automating this process, the rate of mappings went from 3,000/year to 130,000/year
Overhauled unit testing procedure, wrote over 100 unit tests
Devised and coded an automated hyperparameter tuning system (ASK ME ABOUT THIS!)
Architected a churn model from very limited usage data that automated a manual process,
saving over 70 man-hours per month

Springboard	Sept. 2020 – May 2021
Data Science Fellow
Visualization, Time-Series Analysis: Named the borough of London in which property investments have the fastest growth in value
NLP: Cleaned and tokenized text to predict review ratings; identified the words that most indicate positive/negative sentiment
Business Impact: Used a random forest model for price analysis and to make property improvement suggestions to a ski resort;
estimated revenue increases from $33 million to $50 million annually
Used K Nearest Neighbors, Regression, Clustering, Bayesian analysis, ARIMA modeling, Cosine Similarity,
and other models to solve business problems as needed
Built the computer skills, analytical skills, and communication skills necessary for success as a data scientist

West Texas A&M University	Aug. 2019 – May 2020
Graduate Teaching Assistant
Developed lesson plans/presentation to teach complex mathematics to non-technical students
Lectures to 4 classes of 30+ students
Achieved a pass rate over 50% in a developmental course, compared to the average of 35%

PROJECTS
JohnnAI Resume Assistant    May 2024
Connected to ChatGPT, connected to documents and chat history using Langchain
Deployed on Streamlit
You are talking to JohnnAI right now

Personal Project	May 2021 – June 2021
CNN-LSTM Forecasting and Portfolio Optimization
Wrangled, compiled, cleaned, and explored datasets from multiple databases
Selected stocks from the NYSE to create a low-correlation investment universe
Devised an economic factor model of stock returns and created cutting-edge neural network models to
predict behavior of each stock
Optimized stock portfolio to achieve maximum risk-adjusted reward
Backtested investment strategy – Outperformed benchmarks; Annual Sharpe: 0.90


Ensemble Reinforcement Learning for Futures Trading     March 2021 - May 2021
Loaded, cleaned, and prepared price data on 78 futures contracts
Coded training, validation, and trading environments for use with OpenAI Gym
Implemented A2C, PPO, and DDPG reinforcement learning algorithms and combined them into one ensemble,
AI-driven trading strategy
Sentiment in Reporting: A data-driven analysis of bias in 15 major publications
Performed sentiment analysis on over 140,000 news articles
Used linear regression and Tukey HSD hypothesis testing to highlight significant differences in sentiment
Used Agglomerative Hierarchical clustering, K-Mean clustering, and DBSCAN to explore relationships between publications
and divide news sources into groups based on political sentiment
