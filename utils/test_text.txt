My name is John. I like Gabi. I was born on August 20th, 1990.
I have a master's degree in math from West Texas A&M University.
I have worked as a data scientist and I am getting into generative AI.
I really love learning about math and statistics.
I think generative AI is the future. When we create an AI that can create better AI than a human can, the troubles of man will be over.
I believe that communism is the only possible way forward for humanity.
